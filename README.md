* Terminal Minesweeper clone (CLI)

** Quick Start

Can be run in any terminal. (Should support Windows and Linux, only Windows is tested so far.)
''' Console
python main.py
'''

Ideally, create a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment (only has to be done once):
''' Console
python -m venv my_env
'''
To start it:
''' Console
my_env/Scripts/activate
'''
If run in PowerShell, you might need to set policies beforehand.
 - start PowerShell in Administrator mode
 - '''Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force'''
