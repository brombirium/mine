## Quick Start

Can be run in any terminal. (Should support Windows and Linux, only Windows is tested so far.)
``` Console
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

> ## Creating a Virtual Environment
>
> Ideally, create a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment (only has to be done once):
> ``` Console
> python -m venv my_env
> ```
> To start it:
> ``` Console
> my_env/Scripts/activate
> ```
> If run in PowerShell, you might need to set policies beforehand.
>  - start PowerShell in Administrator mode
>  - '''Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force'''
>
> After creation, install the requirements in the virtual environment. Then run the script.
> ``` Console
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python main.py
> ```
